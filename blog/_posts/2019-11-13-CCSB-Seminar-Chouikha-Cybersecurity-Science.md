# Abstract

In 2003 President Bush declared “The way business is transacted, government operates, and national defense is conducted have changed. These activities now rely on an interdependent network of information technology infrastructures called cyberspace.” That same year a national strategic plan to secure cyberspace was published. In this talk, the presenter will discuss the relevance and the impact of cybersecurity since then. Illustrative examples will be given to describe the landscape and to emphasis the importance of the creation of a unified view of cybersecurity based on existing and new tools. The presenter will also describe how PVAMU can be involved in this endeavor. The talk will be kept to a minimum of technical details, but those technical terms needed will be defined in the context of their use.
