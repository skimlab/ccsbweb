Congratulations! Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (Dr. Dong) gets a gift ($25,000) from Intel Corporation to support Prof. Xishuang Dong’s Infusing Deep Learning into Electrical and Computer Engineering Curriculum (“Curriculum”). 

**Project Summary:** A team from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Prairie View A&M University plans to advance evidenced-based learning in STEM education for enhancing the ECE curricula by incorporating the emerging paradigm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the curricula. This project will attract and prepare students to comprehensively understand the types of technologies that can be utilized to design and implement AI solutions to data analytics challenges by exploring a variety of existing and emerging technologies. Specifically, we will use Intel&reg; AI technologies including Intel&reg; Distribution of OpenVINO&trade; toolkit and Intel&reg; Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS 2) to implement this project, and build and deploy deep learning inference for computer vision on edge devices. Upon the completion of this project, it will increase the awareness of Intel&reg; AI technologies, enhance the ECE curriculum, and equip students with AI knowledge to become the future workforce through learning AI concepts and completing course projects and senior design projects for real-world applications.
