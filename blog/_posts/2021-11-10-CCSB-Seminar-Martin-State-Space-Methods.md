## Abstract

In this talk we will discuss process synthesis tools inspired by concepts of system engineering that can identify globally optimal designs of chemical and biological processes. The methods and studies presented will highlight our ongoing efforts to develop systems approaches to probe fundamental questions in engineering and innovate new technologies. Applications include (i) photocatalytic advanced oxidation processes for water polishing, (ii) synthesis of water-splitting thermochemical cycles for hydrogen production, and (iii) topological metabolic network analysis techniques to aid in the enhanced production of bio-derived products.


## Speaker Bio

[Dr. Lealon L. Martin](https://www.pvamu.edu/cheg/faculty-and-staff/cheg-faculty-martin/) is an assistant professor in the Chemical Engineering Department here at Prairie View A&M University. He received his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from Tuskegee University, and a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at UCLA in the area of Process Systems Engineering. Prior to joining Prairie View, Lealon served on the faculty at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY - with joint appointments in the Iserman Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and the Department of Decision Science and Engineering Systems. He also served on the faculty at the University of Texas at Austin in the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering.
