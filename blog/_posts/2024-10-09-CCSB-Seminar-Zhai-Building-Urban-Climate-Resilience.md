## Abstract

This presentation focuses on building urban climate resilience using spatial data science to address climate risks such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and flooding. The research incorporates urban sensing, traditional GIS data, and near real-time urban big data to enhance decision-making for preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Key areas of study include post-disaster damage assessment using deep learning techniques, mobility prediction in extreme weather conditions, and the socioeconomic disparities in mobility recovery. Through collaborations with various stakeholders, including governmental agencies and NGOs, we provide valuable insights into urban resilience strategies.


## Speaker Bio

[Dr. Wei Zhai](https://klesse.utsa.edu/faculty/profiles/zhai-wei.html) is an Assistant Professor of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Texas at San Antonio, focusing on urban resilience and urban science. His research interests center on how to make cities smart and resilient in the face of hurricane, flooding, extreme heat, etc. He is currently working on two NSF-funded projects focused on urban digital twins and community resilience, as well as collaborating on two heat mitigation research projects with the City of San Antonio.
