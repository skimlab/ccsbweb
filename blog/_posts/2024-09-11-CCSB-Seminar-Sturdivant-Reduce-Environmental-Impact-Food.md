## Abstract

Food production is the main driver of biodiversity loss, species extinction, river pollution, and will be critical to keeping the climate within safe limits. Many people and businesses don’t realize their daily food choices can be such a big cause of and solution to our most critical environmental issues. This lecture is given through the Sustainable Food Management Program which seeks to reduce wasted food and its associated impacts over the entire life cycle, starting with the use of natural resources, manufacturing, sales, and consumption, and ending with decisions on recovery or final disposal. EPA works to promote innovation and highlight the value and efficient management of food as a resource. Through the sustainable management of food, we can help businesses and consumers save money, provide a bridge in our communities for those who do not have enough to eat, and conserve resources for future generations. The Sustainable Food Management Program is managed by the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery under the authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
