[Dr. Xishuang Dong](https://ccsb.pvamu.edu/team/xishuang-dong/) presented the *Accelerated Data Science Teaching Kit: a comprehensive set of free teaching materials and hands-on programming assignments* in [Higher Education and Research Conference Sessions](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/topics/academia-research/) at [GTC 2021 (April 12-23, 2021)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/), in collaboration with Dr. Polo Chau (Associate Professor, The Georgia Institute of Technology) and Joe Bungo (Deep Learning Program Manager at NVIDIA).  

**Abstract**: The demand for data science and analytics skill sets is booming, and university classrooms are at the forefront of nurturing the next generation of students in these emerging technologies. We'll introduce educators to the Accelerated Data Science Teaching Kit: a comprehensive set of free teaching materials and hands-on programming assignments covering topics such as data collection and preprocessing, GPU-accelerated machine learning, and data visualization. In addition to the fundamentals and academic theory, educators also leverage the open-source RAPIDS framework for accelerated data science using GPUs on-premises or with included cloud credits. Additionally, we'll address important issues such as techniques to resolve bias and fairness in data science. This offering is a collaborative effort between NVIDIAâ€™s Deep Learning Institute (DLI), Professor Polo Chau from Georgia Tech, and Professor Xishuang Dong from Prairie View A&M University in Texas.
