## Abstract

Predicting gene expression in DREAM Challenges 2022 is beneficial for gaining insights into gene function, biological pathways, and genes involved in regulating development, cell behavior, and signaling. In this study, a novel ensemble model that integrates “proformer” and ensemble learning techniques is proposed. The approach begins with preprocessing a large dataset of gene sequences provided by the DREAM Challenges 2022. Multiple “proformers” are then constructed, each capable of independently predicting gene expression. The resulting gene expression predictions from the “proformers” are combined through averaging weighted summation of individual prediction from each “proformer” to produce final predictions. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model is able to effectively enhance the prediction performance through comprehensive evaluation with various metrics, and even outperformed the winner in the DREAM Challenges 2022.
