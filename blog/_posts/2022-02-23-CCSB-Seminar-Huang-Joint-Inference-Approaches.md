## Abstract

Recognizing all references to the same event within a document
as well as across documents is vital for information aggregation, storyline generation and many NLP applications, such as event tracking, question answering and text summarization. While it can be more risky and require additional evidence to link event mentions from two distinct documents, resolving event coreference links within a document is equally challenging due to dissimilar event word forms, incomplete event arguments (e.g., event participants, time and location), distinct contexts and long distances between coreferential event mentions.

In this talk, I will first present our work on event coreference resolution that tackles the conundrum  and gradually builds event clusters both within a document and across documents by exploiting inter-dependencies among event mentions in an iterative joint inference approach. Then, I will further present our recent work that focuses on in-document event coreference resolution and  extensively models correlations between event coreference chains and document topic structures by using an Integer Linear Programming based joint inference approach.
