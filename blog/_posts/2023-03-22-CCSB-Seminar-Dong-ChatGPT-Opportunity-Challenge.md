## Abstract

Within 5 days of its launch, ChatGPT, hailed as a milestone in the field of AI, had already attracted one million users, and just two months later, it had reached an impressive 100 million users from all around the world. In fact, ChatGPT even sparked an AI war. This incredible success presents an exciting opportunity for using this tool to enhance research and education across various fields. This talk aims to initiate a discussion on the opportunities and challenges that arise in research and education using ChatGPT. It begins with an introduction to ChatGPT, including a brief history of its development and its model architecture. The talk then explores the research and education opportunities that this platform presents, as well as the major challenges involved in utilizing it. In particular, specific points will be highlighted for HBCUs. Finally, the talk will showcase the potential works that can be done in research and education using ChatGPT.
