Senior Computer Science student [Nneka Ede]({% post_url 2018-06-01-nneka-ede %}), supervised by [Dr. Dumitru Iacobas]({% post_url 2017-11-15-dumitru-iacobas %}), was awarded "Undergraduate Student Research Funding Program" for the project "Development of Cancer GMR Software Package for Personalized Cancer Gene Therapy". The software automatizes the quest for Gene Master Regulators (GMR) of cancer nuclei from gene expression profiles of surgically removed tumors. The research is important because silencing the GMRs selectively kills the cancer cells with minimal effects on the normal cells of the tissue.
