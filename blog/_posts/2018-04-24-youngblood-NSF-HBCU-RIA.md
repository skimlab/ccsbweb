Today, Dr. Youngblood at the [Department of Biology](https://www.pvamu.edu/biology/) at PVAMU was awarded NSF HBCU-RIA grant in collaboration with [CCSB@PVAMU]({{ site.baseurl }}/), the first of many more to come for us.  The project, "Characterization and development of young leaves of Glyphosate Susceptible Amaranthus palmeri vs Glyphosate Resistant Amaranthus palmeri after exposure", is to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences, in collaboration with the Center for Computational Systems Biology at the Prairie View A&M University.
