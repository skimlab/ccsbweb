<img class="offset" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/team/tesfamichael-kebrom.jpg" style="width:125px;float:left;border:3px solid black;margin:10px 10px;"> On April 16, 2019, [Dr. Tesfamichael Kebrom]({% post_url /team/2019-04-16-tesfamichael-kebrom %}) joined the [Center for Computational Systems Biology (CCSB)](https://ccsb.pvamu.edu) and the [Cooperative Agricultural Research Center (CARC)](https://www.pvamu.edu/cahs/carc/), a Research Scientist for Plant Systems Biology.  Research Scientist for Plant Systems Biology is a joint appointment between the Center for Computational Systems Biology (CCSB) in the [Roy G. Perry College of Engineering](http://www.pvamu.edu/engineering/) and the Cooperative Agriculture Research Center (CARC) in the [College of Agriculture and Human Sciences](http://www.pvamu.edu/cahs/).  Dr. Kebrom will closely collaborate with other researchers in both CCSB and CARC to develop Plant Systems Biology research program and apply for external research funding to sustain the program.  Both CCSB and CARC provides support for Dr. Kebrom to establish initial research program.  This appointment clearly illustrates both CCSB and CARC recognize their mission: to promote collaborative research, beyond the boundaries.  Both [Dr. D'Souza (Dean, CAHS)](http://www.pvamu.edu/cahs/college-welcome/) and [Dr. Obiomon (Dean, COE)](http://www.pvamu.edu/engineering/about/welcome/) supported this joint appointment, stating "this aligns with the vision of the College of Engineering and the College of Agriculture and Human Sciences."
