## Abstract

Most cancers are epithelial in origin and can invade other tissues, and we seek to understand: 1) How germline and somatic mutations may contribute to pathogenesis and perturbed immunity in reproductive cancers. Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of death among cancer cases in US men. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be over 190,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the US in 2020. It is estimated that one out of 9 men will receive a prostate cancer diagnosis in their lifetime. A study examining molecular mechanisms identified 362 differentially expressed genes in signaling pathways regulating tumor aggressiveness. The goal of our current projects is to determine the role of variants of undetermined significance on prostate or cervical cancer cell gene expression, apoptosis and proliferation. We will use the All of Us Research Hub to identify variants. Although known variants of pathogenicity have been linked to disease for prominent DNA repair genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, certain rare variants have not been elucidated for functionality.  The objectives are to express clinical variants of BRCA2 in prostate cancer cells and examine gene expression, homologous recombination, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. In a future direction, we aim to determine the responsiveness of cancer cells with variant mutations to current targeted therapies.
