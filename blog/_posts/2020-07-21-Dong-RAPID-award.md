Congratulations! Dr. Dong was awarded with Rapid-Response Grant Program (RAPID) from [Division of Research & Innovation](https://www.pvamu.edu/research/), Prairie View A&M University, for his study, "Semi-supervised Deep Learning for Effective COVID-19 Classification on Medical Images".


**Principal Investigator (PI):** Dong, Xishuang, Assistant Professor, Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Roy G. Perry College of Engineering, Office Phone: (936)261-9865.

**Proposal Abstract:** Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic in over 200 countries and territories. Imaging findings play a critical role in constraining the viral transmission and also fighting against COVID-19 in the early stage of its spreading. The objective of this project is to develop a software that is capable of implementing classification of COVID-19 pathology on medical images through building semi-supervised deep learning models. Specifically, the software can complete COVID-19 classification using a huge amount of medical images without annotations, which significantly reduces the cost of labeling images to build high-performance models.

**Proposal Impact Statement:** The proposed effort will advance various areas including big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and medical knowledge mining, which significantly meets with the research priorities of the university. Furthermore, it will help educate the students with state-of-the-art technologies and train them becoming highly qualified workforce for the future career.

**Statement of Compliance:** I/We will carry out all of the research activities included in this RAPID Grant Proposal in accordance with PVAMUâ€™s policy and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help prevent the spread of the disease.
