**Project Title:** CAP: Semi-supervised Fairness-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Construction on Social Media for AI-Enhanced Juvenile Justice

**Principal Investigator:** Xishuang Dong

**Project Description:** Social media serves as a dual-edged platform, not solely exploited by gang-affiliated youth to provoke physical altercations and rivalries, but also widely used by community members to share information about violence and gang conflicts. To fortify violence prevention, a collaborative team from PVAMU’s Colleges of Engineering and Juvenile Justice aims to develop fairness-enhanced knowledge graphs (FKGs) from social media data. These graphs seek to unveil the real-world intricacies, consequences, and local insights into youth violence cycles. The FKG creation involves ensuring fair data representation, constructing semi-supervised graphs, and evaluating their quality. This initiative also focuses on training African American students in multidisciplinary skills, expanding career opportunities, and bolstering AI infrastructure, aligning with broader AI research initiatives. The project's educational objective aims to elevate African American representation in science and engineering by revamping curricula, mentoring students in interdisciplinary research, and engaging in AI-related competitions. Outreach initiatives intend to recruit students and facilitate broader HBCU community participation. This endeavor harmonizes with institutional goals, nurturing the growth of PVAMU’s Ph.D. programs, ultimately amplifying the university's AI prowess.
