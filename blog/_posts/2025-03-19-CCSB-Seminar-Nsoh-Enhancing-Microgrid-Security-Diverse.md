## Abstract

As microgrids and distributed energy resources (DERs) become critical components of modern energy infrastructures, their increasing digitalization exposes them to sophisticated cyber threats. This talk explores an innovative approach to securing microgrids through the integration of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and Bayesian optimization, ensuring resilience against advanced cyberattacks while maintaining optimal operational efficiency.

The presentation will examine real-world case studies from urban environments (Houston, TX, and Kigali, Rwanda) and rural regions (Northwestern Cameroon and Texas, USA), demonstrating how Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles can enhance security in diverse settings. Dr. Nsoh demonstrates that leveraging Bayesian optimization to dynamically adjust DER operational parameters improves the detection and mitigation of security anomalies, achieving 95%–98% precision in anomaly detection. Additionally, we explore the role of zero-shot learning (ZSL) in identifying zero-day attacks, highlighting its potential to enhance cyber resilience in critical energy systems.

Attendees will gain insights into innovative cybersecurity strategies for energy resilience, the impact of machine learning in anomaly detection, and the broader implications for smart grids and critical infrastructure protection. This seminar is particularly relevant for researchers, engineers, and policymakers interested in the intersection of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and critical infrastructure such as energy systems.
