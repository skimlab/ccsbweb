## Abstract

Autonomous systems are systems that can accomplish a task, achieve a goal, or interact with their surroundings with minimal to no human involvement. Autonomous systems have quickly grown in popularity. Today, different facets of artificial intelligence are seamlessly integrated using a systems approach to ensure the effective functioning of autonomous systems. Such systems serve as excellent examples of leading-edge artificial intelligence-based applications. This talk introduces autonomous systems with a focus on smart sensors for environment perception, navigation and obstacle avoidance, mission and path planning, and autonomous systems motion control. Applications in healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, energy, public service, security, and transportation will also be discussed.
