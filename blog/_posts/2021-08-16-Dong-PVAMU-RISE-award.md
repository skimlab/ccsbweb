Congratulations! [Dr. Dong](https://ccsb.pvamu.edu/team/xishuang-dong/) received $10,000 Faculty-RISE Graduate Research Award, from [Division of Research & Innovation](https://www.pvamu.edu/research/) at the Prairie View A&M University.  The grant will be used to support his doctoral student, Luch Nwuso for Fall 2021. 


**Title**: Development of Mobile COVID-19 Detector on Chest X-ray Images


**Project Summary**: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 resulted in more than 35 millions of people infected and more than 61,000 deaths in US. Chest X-ray and thoracic CT are easily accessible imaging equipment for differentiating bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19 with imaging features. Artificial intelligence has empowered X-ray image analytics for building COVID-19 detectors with deep learning techniques. However, it is challenging to clinical staff involved in remote healthcare to timely access these detectors regarding data security and communication cost. The overall objective of this project is to develop a mobile COVID-19 detector that can be accessible to medical staff to help enhance COVID-19 diagnosis, where the detector is able to point out the COVID-19 infected regions on X-ray images. It will enhance the accessibility of COVID-19 diagnosis resources for medical staff, especially for the area without high-quality medical resources.
