## Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic in over 200 countries and territories, which has resulted in a great public health concern across the international community. Imaging findings in CT scan and X-ray play a critical role in timely and accurate screening and fighting against COVID-19. Deep learning has been applied to recognize COVID-19 pathology by image classification and image segmentation. However, these studies focus on supervised deep learning techniques that require a large amount of annotated images to complete training models with high performance, which is not applicable for data analysis that is related to emerging events such as COVID-19 outbreak. To address this challenge, this paper proposed a semi-supervised deep learning model based on Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for COVID-19 pathology classification on medical images. Specifically, the proposed method is capable of completing classification with an extremely limited amount of annotated images and substantial unannotated images. Experimental results on the big medical image dataset COVIDx demonstrate that the proposed model is able to achieve very promising performance even by learning on the extremely limited amount of labeled medical images.
