# Abstract

Published transcriptomic data from surgically removed metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma samples were analyzed from the genomic fabric paradigm (GFP) perspective to identify the best targets for gene therapy. GFP considers the transcriptome as a multi-dimensional mathematical object constrained by a dynamic set of expression controls and correlations among genes. Every gene in the chest wall metastasis, two distinct cancer nodules, and the surrounding normal tissue of the right kidney was characterized by three independent measures: average expression level, relative expression variation, and expression correlation with each other gene. The analyses determined the cancer-induced regulation, control, and remodeling of the chemokine and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, apoptosis, basal transcription factors, cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, renal cell carcinoma, and RNA polymerase pathways. Interestingly, the three cancer regions exhibited different transcriptomic organization, suggesting that the gene therapy should not be personalized only for every patient but also for each major cancer nodule. The gene hierarchy was established on the basis of gene commanding height, and the gene master regulators DAPK3,TASOR, FAM27C and ALG13 were identified in each profiled region. We delineated the molecular mechanisms by which TASOR overexpression and ALG13 silencing would selectively affect the cancer cells with little consequences for the normal cells.
