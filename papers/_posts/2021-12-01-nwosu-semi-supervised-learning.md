# Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an on- going global pandemic in over 200 countries and territories, which has resulted in a great public health concern across the international community. Analysis of X-ray imaging data can play a critical role in timely and accurate screening and fighting against COVID-19. Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied to recognize COVID-19 pathology from X- ray imaging datasets. However, it requires a substantial amount of annotated X-ray images to train models, which is often not applicable to data analysis for emerging events such as COVID- 19 outbreak, especially in the early stage of the outbreak. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a two-path semi- supervised deep learning model, ssResNet, based on Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for COVID-19 image classification, where two paths refer to a supervised path and an unsupervised path, respectively. Moreover, we design a weighted supervised loss that assigns higher weight for the minority classes in the training process to resolve the data imbalance. Experimental results on a large-scale of X-ray image dataset COVIDx demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve promising performance even when trained on very few labeled training images.
