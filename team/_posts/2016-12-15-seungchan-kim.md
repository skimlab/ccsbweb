Dr. Seungchan Kim is a Chief Scientist and Executive Professor at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.pvamu.edu/ece/) and the Director of the CRI [Center for Computational Systems Biology]({{site.baseurl}}{{"/"}}) at the [Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU)](http://www.pvamu.edu).  Prior to this appointment, he was the Head of Biocomputing Unit and an Associate Professor at Integrated Cancer Genomics Division of [Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen)](http://www.tgen.org).  He was one of the founding faculty members of TGen, founded in 2002, by Dr. Trent, then-Scientific Director of the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov) at the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov), leading computational systems biology research at the institute.  He was also an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computing, Informatics, Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE)](https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu) at the [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu) from 2004 till 2011.  Dr. Kim received B.S. and M.S. degrees in [Agriculture Engineering](http://bse.snu.ac.kr/) from the [Seoul National University](http://www.snu.ac.kr), and Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/) from the [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu). He also got his post-doctoral training at the Cancer Genetics Branch of [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov).

Dr. Kim's research interests include: 1) mathematical modeling of genetic regulatory networks, 2) development of computational methods to analyze multitude of high throughput multi-omics data to identify disease biomarkers, and 3) computational models to diagnose patients or predict patient outcomes, for example, disease subtypes or drug response. His studies have had a large influence on the development of computational tools to study underlying mechanisms for cancer development and better understand the molecular mechanisms behind cancer biology and biological systems.
