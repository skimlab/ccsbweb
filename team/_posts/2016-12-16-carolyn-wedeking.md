Ms. Carolyn Wedeking is an Administrative Associate (III) for the CRI [Center for Computational Systems Biology (CCSB@PVAMU)]({{site.baseurl}}{{"/"}}) and the [Center of Excellence in Research and Education for Big Military Data Intelligence (CREDIT Center)](http://credit.pvamu.edu) at the [Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU)](http://www.pvamu.edu).  She has been working at PVAMU since 1987, first as the Scheduler for the Office of the Registrar. In 1988, she moved to the Roy G. Perry College of Engineering as the Administrative Assistant for the Associate Dean.  In 1996, she joined the NASA Center for Applied Radiation Research (CARR) as an Administrative Assistant, until 2006.  In 2006, the Graduate School Dean asked her to work for the Office of Graduate Studies.  Ms. Wedeking returned to the same research team as CARR when they received the [NASA Center for Radiation Engineering, Science and Space Exploration (CRESSE)](https://www.pvamu.edu/cresse/) an Administrative Assistant III to assist Dr. Richard  Wilkins & Dr. Kelvin Kirby (2010 - 2015).  She still maintains her office at CRESSE Engineering Technology Building Room 108B to help the center, but her main responsibility has shifted to support Dr. Seungchan Kim (CCSB) and Dr. Lijun Qian (CREDIT) since 2015.
 
She enjoys assisting research scientists so that they can focus on research while she can take care of administrative tasks.  Ms. Wedeking has lived her life as a resident of Waller County where the Prairie View A&M University is located.
