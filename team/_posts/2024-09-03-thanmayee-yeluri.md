Thanmayee Yeluri is a dedicated Graduate Research Assistant at Prairie View A&M University, working under the supervision of Dr. Noushin Ghaffari and Dr. Seungchan Kim. She specializes in bioinformatics, machine learning, and epigenomics, with a strong focus on analyzing DNA methylation patterns and gene regulation using computational approaches. Her research applies advanced neural network models to study differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across various species, particularly in non-model organisms. Thanmayee has also worked on precision agriculture projects, IoT-based environmental monitoring systems, and autonomous agricultural robotics, utilizing her expertise in data analytics and predictive modeling.

**Projects & Research**
  - Machine Learning for DMR Classification in Seal Species – Investigating Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) in three seal species to understand how epigenetic changes contribute to adaptation. The project employs Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) to classify DMRs with high precision. CG files were processed using the BSSeeker pipeline, followed by differential methylation analysis and annotation, to curate training datasets. The model was trained on these well-defined DMR and non-DMR regions, improving accuracy in detecting adaptive methylation patterns.
  - Bioinformatics & Genomic Data Analysis – Applied R and Bioconductor for sequencing data preprocessing, quality control, and biomarker identification.
  - Precision Agriculture using UAVs & sUAS – Conducted research on crop health monitoring using high-resolution aerial imagery and data-driven predictive modeling.
  - IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring System – Developed a real-time environmental monitoring system using Raspberry Pi and cloud integration.
  - Autonomous Agricultural Robot for Precision Farming – Designed an AI-powered robotic system for soil analysis and automated farming.
