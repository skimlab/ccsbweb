                    <p>I am an expert in both experimental and computational genomics. I was also involved in the technology development, performed analyses of the technical noise of microarray platforms and took care of transgenic mouse colonies and genetically engineered cell cultures. My lab has profiled a wide diversity of tissues and cell cultures from blood and various regions of brain, spinal cord, retina, heart, liver, kidney, lung, thyroid and prostate. Through collaboration with other groups, we have studied transcriptomic alterations in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and infectious (with Tripanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium berghei, Borrelia burgdorferi and Enteroccocus faecium) diseases, and following hypoxic or low gravity stress. The tissues and cells were collected from humans but also from animal (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, chicken embryo) models of human diseases. In our studies, we have used cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays (printed by Agilent but also by Einstein, Yale, Rockefeller and Duke University Core Facilities), Affimetrix, Illumina beadchips and RNA sequencers (Illumina MySeq and NextSeq550). I have introduced the “multiple yellow” design (offering the best use of resources), optimized the experimental protocols and developed a powerful normalization algorithm that reduces the technical noise from 30% to 20%. I was the first to consider gene expression variability and expression coordination in addition to the average expression level in biological replicas that increased by an order of magnitude the information provided by transcriptomic studies. My main contribution to the theoretical genomics is the introduction of the Genomic Fabric Paradigm and the development of the mathematically advanced analyses of the Relative Expression Estimate, Coordination Power, Pair-Wise Relevance and Gene Master Regulators. My qualification and experience in all branches of the genomics research is quite unique, almost all investigators being qualified in only one (technological, functional, experimental, computational or bioinformatics) aspect. As such, I can fully conduct the research, train personnel and understand and overcome all problems that may occur during the proposed studies. </p>
