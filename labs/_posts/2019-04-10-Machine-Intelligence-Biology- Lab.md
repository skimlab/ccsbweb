The Machine Intelligence Biology Lab is one part of the Center for Computational Systems
Biology at Prairie View A&amp;M University. The main task of this lab will focus on computational biology,
which is to use existing tools or develop novel methods to speed up the procedure of genetic data
analysis or enhance the analysis performance. It involves two subtasks: 1. Building high-performance
sequencing analysis methods by introducing artificial intelligence techniques with powerful NVIDIA GPU
clusters. Specifically, we will design and develop deep learning based analysis methods to improve
performance; 2. Constructing the general computational platform to complete various tasks involved in
the genetic sequencing analysis by integrating existing tools and novel methods. Furthermore, we will
establish a comfortable research environment to build collaborations with internal members (PVAMU
faculty and staff) and external researchers to promote the development of computational systems
biology. Please contact the Center Director, Seungchan Kim, or the Director of the Machine Intelligence
Biology lab, Xishuang Dong, for further information.
