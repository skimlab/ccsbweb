Genomics Lab offers Illumina sequencing by synthesis. It is equipped to isolate, quantitate, evaluate quality of nucleic acid preparations and prepare libraries for sequencing using a workflow that minimizes contamination. The Illumina sequencer is covered under an annually renewed PROD Care NSQ 550 Comprehensive service contract through Illumina. In addition, we also have resources specifically dedicated to the handling and analysis of DNA and/or RNA sequencing includes: BaseSpace Sequencing Hub with unlimited storage and computing and an in-house analytical pipeline to analyze NGS data
