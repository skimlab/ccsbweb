We use Illumina NextSeq 550 and Agilent gene expression microarrays to profile the transcriptomes of cells and tissues from humans and animal models of human diseases. An original algorithm determines the Gene Master Regulators (GMR) of cancer nuclei in solid and liquid biopsies, or pathogens in blood and urine samples.
